            <h2>The game</h2>
            <p>The object of the game is to score tries by touching the ball on the ground over the opposition team's tryline where 1 point is awarded for each try scored.</p>
            <p>As with all breeds of rugby, the ball is carried forward up the pitch by players on the attacking team running holding the ball. It's important to note that the ball can only be passed backwards from a players hands. The defending team try to contain the attacking team by making touches (tackles) on the attacking player who is holding the ball.</p>
            <p>When a team is attacking they have possession of the ball and are allowed 6 touches before possession is lost, they then become the defending team. After a touch has been made the ball must be played through the legs.</p>
            <h3>The touch (or tackle)</h3>
            <p>The player carrying the ball can be touched anywhere (even on the ball itself) by any defending player. When he/she is touched they must play the ball before open play can resume. Heavy petting is strongly discouraged!</p>
            <h3>Playing the ball</h3>
            <p>A touched player must play the ball through their legs by placing it on the ground, on the mark, while stepping over it. The ball does not have to be played with the foot or rolled backwards. You'll find more experienced players will anticipate or initiate the touch. While playing the ball the player playing the ball must have their shoulders square facing their opponent's tryline. The entire defending team must retreat 5 metres backwards from the mark to an imaginary line called the offside line. The offside line would stretch from touchline to touchline laterally across the pitch. To be onside after retreating the defending players must not move forwards until the ball has picked up by the dummy half.</p>
            <h3>Dummy half</h3>
            <p>The dummy half is the player who picks up the ball from the ground after it has been played. The dummy half can be anyone but is usually the closest attacking player to play of the ball. The dummy half cannot score and cannot be caught in possession. It's usually always recommended that the dummy half passes the ball to another player on his/her team. Upon passing the ball they are no longer regarded as the dummy half.</p>
            <p>To score attacking players can use up to 6 touches to attempt to cross their opponent's tryline however possession of the ball must be relinquished for a number of other offenses.</p>
